# Temp Converter

A react app that converts temperature values from F <--> C

### Here's what to do:

- build a temperature converter between F and C
  - C = (F-32)\*(5/9)
  - F = C\*(9/5)+32
- Start a new react app with the Vite react template
- Add two components, the Fahrenheit component and the Celsius component, both children of the root component
- Both components should have:
  - an input field to enter temp
  - the temp in that unit rendered on page
  - a button to calculate the conversion
- Users should be able to enter a temp in either F or C, click the button, and see the other component update with the newly calculated temp.
- Use lifting state to lift the input to the shared parent component, convert the temperature, then send it down to the other child component to be displayed.

### Stretch Goals:

- Update the app so that just entering a temp causes the conversion to occur immedately, no button press necessary
- Update the temperature displayed in the input boxes immediately so the two inputs are both always synced
- Add a third component, one for temperatures in Kelvin
